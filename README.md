# Vue Finance Manager

A modern, personal finance manager web app built with **Vue 3** and **Vuetify**.

This project helps you track:

- Paychecks and income every two weeks
- Spending by category (credit cards, bills, etc.)
- Savings balances (cash, 401k, gold)
- Gold holdings in grams, auto-updated with live gold prices
- Historical records for yearly reporting
- Beautiful charts to visualize your finances
- Year-end export to PDF or Excel

The app is designed to start small (local-only) and gradually grow into a fully-deployed, full-stack solution as I learn more about Vue, JavaScript, and backend development.
